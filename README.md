# Rijksmuseum final project (sintlucas)

For this exercise, I developed a web application for the Rijksmuseum. The main goal was to allow visitors to scan a QR code and view information about the related painting. Through this project, I learned a lot about building web applications, working within a tight schedule, and collaborating effectively with other students to create an awesome project.

You can see the final product at: [Rijksmuseum application](https://rijksmuseum.lukevdbroek.nl/homepage)

### Features
- Scan QR codes to view painting information.
- Interactive and mobile-friendly design.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm run dev`.

# Final Project

The main purpose of this project is showing your programming skills.
You will work alone or in a team of 2 students.

## Collect proof of work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Photo of the end result.
* Video's of tests.
* Technical design (Tinkercad, WokWi, ...).
* ...

## General planning
2 day parts a week (3 hours each) for 8 weeks. In total 48 hours.

## Phases of the project
Make sure you loop through these phases during the project:

### Proposal + MoSCoW + Design
* Read what the project is about in the PROPOSAL.md, which you can find in the sintlucas folder.
* Ask for details if you still have questions.
* Start designing the application (see below).

### Technical Design: game (if applicable)
A Game Design Document
* Visualizations
* Mechanics
* Dynamics
* Aesthetics

### Technical Design: website, (web) application, VR/AR application, physical computing (if applicable)
A technical design is a translation of the proposal (functional design) to technical terms.
You can think of:
* What stack/frameworks will you use (HTML/CSS/JS, frameworks,  etc.)?
* What hardware do you need?
* What parts does your application consist of?
* How will these parts work together (front-end/back-end/database/webservice/...)?
* What data does your application need and how you will you store it (REST webservice/database/SessionStorage api/...)?
* Are there any security risks and how will you deal with them?
* How important is the performance?
* How will you deploy it?
* How will you test it?
* ...

A User Interface design, think of:
* Draw (paper or digital) a wireframe.
* Write a style guide with more info about fonts, colors, logo etc.
* ...

### User Interface design (if applicable)
Create a user interface design (drawing) and save a screenshot in the `sintlucas` folder.

## Prepare
* Write down the Issues (user stories) in `GitHub Issues` (which will act as your backlog).
* Use the MoSCoW method to prioritize the backlog items (M: Must have, S: Should have, C: Could have, W: Won't have).
* Create a Scrum Board in GitHub Projects.
* Refine each item into smaller, more technical items (this is called the sprint planning).
* Place just enough refined items in the Scrum Board in the ToDo column (this is called the sprint backlog).
  Enough means that you can finish all items in the sprint.
 
## Realise: development
* Start each lesson with a stand-up meeting:
  * Open the scrum board
  * Every team member answers these questions:
    * What did you do last time?
    * What will you do today?
    * Are there any impediments in your way?
* Start developing on the sprint backlog items (ToDo).

Don't forget:
* Pull the changes of your team members regularly.
* Commit and push your changes regularly to prevent merge conflicts.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.

## Test
* Think beforehand how you will test your application/product.
* Make video's/photos of the tests and place them in the sintlucas folder.

## Feedback and feedforward
* During development, you will get a review and a retrospective with one of the teachers.
* During the last lesson you will present the results to the other teams.
* The teacher will evaluate your work (see the file `SD - Feedback en feedforward door docent`). 
  * Your designs are in line with the requirements (6).
  * The issues have been refined into smaller, more technical items (8).
  * The final product is in line with the designs (9).
  * You can argue why you made certain choices (9).
  * The product runs smooth and is bug free (10).
  * The code is clean, readable and follows code conventions (11).
  * The product has been tested (12).
  * You can evaluate the process and are open to feedback (16).
