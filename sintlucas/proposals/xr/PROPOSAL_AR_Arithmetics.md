# Arithmetic

**Product owners (client): Luc**

## Introduction

In this project you will develop a AR production that helps SintLucas students with arithmetics on the topic of volume and perimeters. This is a real life project, which means it will actually be used. If the product is successful, we will present is at a XR event of Fontys June 21.
The production will show cubes and other 3D Shapes in the real world, using AR
Also, the production will show perimeters in the real world using AR.
As a result, the user (=student) will learn about volume, perimeters and the arithmetic behind it.

## Main Features

<ins>Core Simulation Mechanics</ins>
The production shows both explanations and exercises about the topic.

<ins>User Interaction</ins>: Implement intuitive user controls using AR controls

## User stories
As a player, I want to learn about volume and perimeter
As a player, I want to see explanations and get exercises to see if I learned about the topic
As a player, I want to be able to spawn volumes of different sizes in the real world.
As a player, I want to be engaged and challenged on the topic (f.e. gameplay and reward systems)
