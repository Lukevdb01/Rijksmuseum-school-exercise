# Sweating in your headset

**Product owners (client): Jorrit**

## Introduction
In this project, you will develop a VR sports simulation that includes both the gameplay mechanics of a sport which will be randomly assigned to you and the interactive environment in which it takes place. 
This entails creating a virtual setting that responds to the player's actions, such as crowd reactions in a stadium or additional features which will be specified depending on the sport.
The goal is to produce a VR application that not only simulates the sport itself but also the atmosphere and interactions typical of its surroundings.

You will get a random sport assigned to you by your teacher. This will come with added features and user stories. Add these to this document.

## Main Features

<ins>Core Simulation Mechanics</ins>: Develop a basic simulation of the chosen sport, focusing on the essential mechanics such as hitting a ball, 
throwing, or movement. The simulation should accurately reflect the fundamental physics involved in the sport (e.g., ball trajectory, speed).

<ins>User Interaction</ins>: Implement intuitive user controls using VR hand controllers to perform key actions
(e.g., swinging a racket, throwing a ball). The controls should be responsive and mirror real-life movements 
as closely as possible.

<ins>VR Environment</ins>: Design a simple yet immersive VR environment that resembles a typical setting where the chosen sport is 
played (e.g., tennis court, baseball field). The environment should include basic elements like the playing area and necessary 
equipment (e.g., nets, goals, bases).

<ins>Score system</ins>: Any sport should in some way grade the player's performance. This can be done using score, ranking, counting the total attempts or winning/losing.

## User stories
As a player, I want to use the VR hand controllers to mimic real-life sports movements, so that I can interact with the game in a natural and intuitive way.

As a player, I want to see a realistic simulation of the sport's physics, so that the game feels authentic and challenging.

As a player, I want to play in an environment that resembles an actual venue of the sport, so that I am more immersed in the VR experience.

As a player, I want to understand the basic rules and how to score in the game, so that I can compete and strive to improve my performance.

As a player, I want to receive real-time feedback on my performance (e.g., score, speed, accuracy), so that I can adjust my strategy and technique during the game.

As a player, I want to have a clear start and end to the game, with the ability to restart, so that I can enjoy multiple playthroughs and experiences.

As a player, I want to hear realistic sound effects that match my actions and the environment, so that my immersion in the virtual world is complete.

As a player, I want to engage with various elements in the environment that are not directly related to the sport, so that my experience is enriched beyond just the core gameplay.

- Score should be added according to the official rules of darts. Your score should be displayed in game.
- You will get into trouble when throwing darts into people or breakable objects.
- You should be able to order a drink at the bar while playing.
- There should be a jukebox which the player can use to change the music.

<ins>User stories</ins>:
As a player, I want to accurately throw darts with realistic physics, so that my skill and technique directly influence my performance in the game.

As a player, I want to interact with objects in the bar, like ordering a drink or playing a song on the jukebox, so that the game feels more immersive and enjoyable beyond just playing darts.

As a player, I want to hear and see reactions from the crowd around me based on how well I play, so that the environment feels alive and responsive to my actions.

## Golf
Golf is about relaxing in nature. Make sure the golfing experience feelings like a relaxed trip in nature.
For information about golf: https://www.golfsidekick.com/knowledge/basic-rules-of-golf-for-beginners/

<ins>Main features</ins>:
- Implement physics-based swing mechanics that accurately reflect the power, angle, and spin a player applies to the golf ball, offering a realistic golfing experience.
- You should make a bag which stores your golf clubs that you have to bring along.
- The golf course should take place in nature.
- The wind is relevant to your golf preformance and the tree visuals.
- The environment should feel alive and interactive. Make animals that run away from your golf ball. 
- (Optional)Include a drivable golf cart within the VR environment, allowing players to navigate between holes and explore the course, enhancing the realism of the golf experience.

<ins>User stories</ins>:
As a player, I want to perform golf swings using realistic mechanics, so that my physical actions accurately translate into the game, affecting the distance and direction of my shots.

As a player, I want to have to bring my own golf equipment with me across the golf course, so that I feel more emersed in the real experience.
